 * Directories are sandwiched between two linking entries:

 *
 * Many of the FS functions are designed around taking a directory block
 * (usually called blk_container), and then iterating over it's directory chain
 *
 * The global variable 'g_cur_dir' stores the pointer to the current Directory block.
 * This can intuitively be used for functions within commands.h. For example,
 *
 * dir_list(g_cur_dir) will list your current directory, and 
 * dir_find_entry("name", g_cur_dir) searches your current directory for an entry.
